                        <h3>The Spark of Curiosity</h3>
                        <p>I discovered programming when I was just 12 years old. I was instantly fascinated. But I was in 9th grade, and school exams had to come first. I made a promise to myself: I would return to coding, no matter what.</p>

                        <p>After finishing 10th grade, summer vacation didn't mean rest for me. I started marketing a product in the local market to earn money. Why? Because I needed to pay for my own college education. Nobody else was going to do it for me.</p>

                        <p>While marketing during the day, I picked up programming again at night. Within about 6 months, I became skilled enough to work as a programmer. My first job offered me around $45 per month — a very low salary, but I accepted it. Experience was more valuable than money at that point.</p>

                        <p>I enrolled in Intermediate Computer Science. For the next two years, my days looked like this:</p>

                            <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Attend college classes</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Three jobs. One goal. I paid my own college fees and supported my education for two full years.</p>

                        <p>I understand that trust is earned. Here's why I believe you can trust me:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My story is real — I can share proof of my education, work, and journey</li>
                            <li>I have nothing to hide — my goal is transparent and specific</li>
                            <li>I'm building this website myself — I'm a real programmer, not someone hiding behind anonymity</li>
                            <li>I will stay accountable — regular updates, receipts, and open communication</li>
